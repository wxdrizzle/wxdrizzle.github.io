I am a Ph.D. student in the Department of Electrical & Computer Engineering at the University of Washington, co-advised by Prof. Linda Shapiro and Prof. Chun Yuan.

My research interests include medical image analysis and machine learning. I am dedicated to developing novel statistical models for multimodal image fusion, thereby enhancing disease prevention, diagnoisis and prognosis. My recent work focuses on Bayesian representation learning for multimodal image registration and segmentation.

Before becoming a Ph.D. student at the UW, I worked as a research assistant in statistics in the School of Data Science at Fudan University, supervised by Prof. Xiahai Zhuang. I obtained my B.Eng. degree in Electronic Engineering at Fudan University in 2020, advised by Prof. Jinhua Yu.
